                 *********History of Vi text Editor**********
___________
Introdution
-----------

Vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system.

*****Bill Joy :Cofounder of Sun systems*****
The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976.
As the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley.

## Background ## the name "vi" is derived from the shortest unambiguougs abbreviation for the ex command v
isual. Which switches the ex line editor to visual mode. In addition to various non-free software variants
of vi distributed with proprietary implementations of Unix.

Open Source
^^^^^^^^^^^
Vi was opensourced with OpenSolaris, and several free and open source software vi clones exist.
Joy described 2.0 (vi) as a very large program, barely able to fir in the memeory of a PDP-11/70.
Although vi maybe regarded as a small lightweight, program today, it was not seen that way early in i
ts history.

***Interesting facts***
By version 3.1, shipped with 3BSD in December 1979, the full version of vi was no longer able to fit in
the memory of a PDP-11. The editor would be also too big to run on PC/IX for the IBM PC in 1984.
